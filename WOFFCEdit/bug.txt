bug:
Delete object
Undo <- this is probably the broken part
Copy and paste a new object

Issue:
Paste get's the createCommands created objects' ID then subtracts 1. This lines up with the size of the displayList but not the elements, it's 1 too high.
This works if an object wasn't deleted an remade before.
